## User Story
The user will be tested to see how many artists they can identify by the random album and album name that appear on the screen. The user gains ten points if the answer is correct and will have ten randomized artists (from the top 50 list) to guess.

## Why this app:
**These days, the attention span of internet users is only getting shorter. A lot of internet users enjoy the 30-second or 60-second Buzzfeed-esque quiz because of the lack of effort and instant gratification provided. This quiz is meant to test the user's knowledge on Billboard's top 50 artists of 2016.**
